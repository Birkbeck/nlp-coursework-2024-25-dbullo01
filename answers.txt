Part One - Syntax and Style

1(d) The grade level reading score formula does not measure the difficulty of English language well. It
assumes reading level is higher/more difficult with words with many syllables. The English language has many short
words that are understood by college/university level educated readers but have one or two syllables and the Flesch
Kincaid grade formula would score these shorter words(with one or two syllables) as a lower grade level score.
Which indicates the text is easier to read but in reality isn't  and not an accurate reflection of text difficulty.
There are words in the English language at school reading age that have much more than 1 or 2 syllables and  considered
to have a higher reading score (difficult to read) by the reading formula. Thus the 2 metrics used by the formula do
not handle difficulty of words well in the English language for the different readers (e.g. school children,
university students)

Secondly reliability of grading level score varies according to the sample of text in a document. The score for one part
of a document might vary from the score calculated for another part of the same document. Hence the reliability between
different sections of the document varies.
